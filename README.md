# React 19 useEffect and useState Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates an unusual behavior in React 19 related to `useEffect` and `useState` when the state update function (`setCount` in this case) is called multiple times in rapid succession within a single event handler.

## Bug Description
The issue stems from calling `setCount` twice within the `handleClick` function.  While seemingly straightforward, it leads to an unexpected count update that's not reflected consistently in the `useEffect` hook, especially when the updates happen very quickly. This can be challenging to debug as it's not immediately obvious why `useEffect` doesn't log the expected count values.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Click the 'Increment' button. Observe the console logs and the displayed count. The count might not match the expected increment, and the `useEffect` log might not reflect all intermediate state updates.

## Solution
The solution involves ensuring that state updates are handled in a way that prevents unnecessary or conflicting updates.
